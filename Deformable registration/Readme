Image registration is an essential process to draw correspondence between images.Non-rigid image registration or Deformable Image registration (DIR) differ with rigid 
image registration (RIR),such that all pixel-to-pixel relationships change. In this report, we present a TRE (Target Registration Error) minimization based algorithm 
using Elastix to perform deformable image registration of lungs CT (exhale and inhale) on the DIR-Labâ€™s COPD dataset. Different parameter files were used and
parameter tuning was implemented in order to minimize the TRE. The average TRE (in mm) for the four datasets using the final parameters were 1.62 , 4.3 , 1.974 , and 2.398 for datasets
COPD1, COPD2, COPD3, and COPD4, respectively.
